# landing-page

This project, from The Odin Project, is called Landing Page. The goal of this project is to build an entire web page from a design that will be provided to me by The Odin Project curriculum.

This web page will consist of four main sections (and a footer). The goal is to get our project as close as we can to the design provided, but not to worry about getting it pixel-perfect. The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position, relative to the rest.

 Lastly, we'll have free rein to substitute our own content (images, name, etc.) and colors into this design, but we'll still need to follow the overall layout of the webpage.

 ## Skills Demonstrated
- Structuring an HTML project
- Using HTML elements (headings, paragraphs, links, lists, images,etc.)
- Implementing the skills we've learned thus far in the curriculum
- Creating a landing page from scratch
- Writing clean and organized code

## Reflection
(Coming soon - I'll update this after completing the project to review what I learned.)
